# Thyme 


# Building it

Assuming we have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed first we need to clone and initialize this 
repository via:

```
git clone https://github.com/kerskuchen/thyme.git --recursive
```

Assuming we have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed and can run `cargo` commands we can 
build a release version by just running 

```
cargo run --package ct_executable_packager
```
This creates a new folder named `windows_shipping` which contains the final executable ready to run 
with all needed resources.

If we have the [Resource Hacker](http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/) tool in our `%PATH` the 
above command script will also set a launcher icon and version information for our 
executable.

# Development

We can build a debug version by running the usual `cargo build` command. The 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) website has good information about how to start development 
with Rust.

For development it is a good idea to check out the `cottontail` submodule on the master branch via

```
cd cottontail
git checkout master
```

That will make sure that we don't accidentally commit something to `cottontail` in the 
detached `HEAD` state.
